/*

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence
is generated by adding the previous two
terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the
first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci
sequence whose values do not exceed four
million, find the sum of the even-valued
terms.
